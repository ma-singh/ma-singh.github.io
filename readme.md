# Description

This is the GitHub page for my Portfolio. It showcases the work that I feel best demonstrates my ability and the skill that I've learned in my time at Full Sail. The website itself is created with basic HTML5, with CSS3 and a bit of jQuery used for styling purposes. My projects themselves have descriptions of their purpose as well as the technologies used to create them.
